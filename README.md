# MultiExchange
### By Brian Dang 2017

## Vision
The idea behind Multi Exchange is to create an SMS-interface for buying/selling cryptocurrencies on major exchanges. Navigating apps or webpages and entering numbers in different boxes isn't great.

"Buy $100 of bitcoin at $4000 on gemini"; simple, fast, and effective.

## Security
Yes, your private API keys will need to be stored on third-party servers, but these will be encrypted. More so, user's will be required to 2-FA their actions by default. Only idiots will ask to opt-out.
